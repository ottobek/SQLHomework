# SQL Homework Tasks: Window Functions and Ranking

This document contains SQL homework tasks focusing on window functions (such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, LEAD, and LAG) and cumulative calculations. The tasks are divided into three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Difficult**.
